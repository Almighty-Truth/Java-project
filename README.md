# Java-project 

1.) Read a text file & create the appropriate object for each record, depending on the record type
2.) Add each object to a single arrayList that can hold all 3 types of objects (grandparent, parent,
and child objects)
3.) Once the arrayList is fully populated, process each object by calling its polymorphic methods to:
a. Display how each object celebrates the holidays
b. Tabulates & displays the costs of the celebrations
